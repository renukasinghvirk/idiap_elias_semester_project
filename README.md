# Mapping and Extracting Migration Narratives and Counter-Narratives
This project is realized in the context of the [ELIAS project](https://elias-ai.eu/) use case 4, which aims at mitigating misinformed migrant perception in Europe.

In this project, we focus on narratives around migration, and try to produce counter-narratives using reliable source (we use the [EMN country factsheet](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/european-migration-network-emn/emn-publications/country-factsheets_en)).
